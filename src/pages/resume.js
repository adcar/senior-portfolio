    <p>Dear Recruiter, Jason Gordon:</p>

    <p>
      My experience with web design and development makes me an ideal candidate
      for your Front End Software Engineer position. Your company stays on the
      edge of innovation, with constant improvements for both developers and the
      world in general. I hope that with my skill set and motivation, you will
      consider me for this position. I am well rounded in HTML, CSS, and JS.
      AngularJS is one of my strongest skills, and I will utilize this in the
      work environment. I am constantly eager to learn more and am deeply
      passionate about both web design and development. I look forward to
      contacting you in a few days. If you have any questions before then, feel
      free to contact me at acardosi@vt.ewsd.org.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you,</p>

    <p>Alexander Cardosi </p>
